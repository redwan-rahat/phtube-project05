        <p class="text-black text-2xl "> var: We used to use this tool a lot, but it caused some issues because it could be used anywhere, making things confusing. Nowadays, we prefer not to use it much in modern JavaScript. <br>

            let: This tool is handy within specific areas of our code. It helps us avoid mix-ups and keeps things neat and clean, making our code more organized. <br>
            
            const: Similar to let, but once we decide what job this tool has, it sticks with it. It's like having a helper that doesn't change tasks, making our code stronger and less prone to mistakes.</p><br>

        <h1 class="text-black text-5xl mb-8 mt-4 font-bold">Tell us the use cases of `null` and `undefined`</h1>
        <p class="text-black text-2xl ">
            null: <br>
        
Explicitly Empty Value: Represents intentional absence of any object value. <br>
Assignment to Clear Value: Assigning null clears a variable's value. <br>
Checking for Absence: Used in conditionals to check if a variable has a meaningful value <br><br>

undefined: <br>
Default Value for Uninitialized Variables: Unassigned variables default to undefined. <br>
Function Parameters without Values: Fewer arguments than declared parameters result in undefined. <br>
Property that Does Not Exist: Accessing a non-existent object property returns undefined. <br>
Return Value of Functions Without Explicit Return: Functions without a return statement implicitly return undefined. <br>

    <h1 class="text-black text-5xl mb-8 mt-4 font-bold">What do you mean by REST API?</h1>
    <p class="text-black text-2xl "> A REST API is a set of rules for building and interacting with web services. It uses standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, and DELETE to perform operations on resources, typically in a stateless manner. REST APIs rely on a client-server architecture, with resources identified by URIs. Data is exchanged in a lightweight format, often JSON, making it easy for different systems to communicate seamlessly.</p><br>
